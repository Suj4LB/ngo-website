# Project Setup Instructions

Thank you for checking out this project! Hereâ€™s a simple guide to get the website up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. You'll also need [Nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon), which you can install with the following command:

```bash
npm install -g nodemon

Running the Project
Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Navigate to the Project Directory

bash
Copy code
cd <project-directory>
Start the Application

Run the following command to start the application:

bash
Copy code
nodemon index.js
Note on MongoDB Atlas Cluster
The MongoDB Atlas connection for this project is currently not functional. Any assistance in debugging or resolving this would be highly appreciated!


When you paste this into your README file on GitHub, it will appear formatted with headings, code blocks, and sections just like I showed. Replace `<repository-url>` and `<project-directory>` with the appropriate values for your project.
